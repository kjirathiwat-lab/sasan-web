Please update the SASAN website with the following changes:

## 1. REVERT LAYOUT TO MOBILE-FIRST (Remove previous desktop scaling fix)

If you previously added responsive desktop scaling, please remove it and return to the original mobile-first layout (max-width around 480px centered). The website will now be embedded in WordPress as a theme, not iframe, so we need the original compact mobile design.

## 2. REPLACE ServiceWizard with NEW ServiceSelector Component

Replace the current ServiceWizard.tsx with a new "One Stop Service" design that has 2 modes:

### Mode 1: Package Mode (Simple - Recommended)
- User selects 1 of 4 packages (Memoir, Narrative, Legacy, Masterpiece)
- Package includes everything - no complex choices needed
- User can only customize: Casket style + Floral color (optional small adjustments)
- Shows package details and total price
- Click "Contact Us" to finish

### Mode 2: Custom Mode (Flexible)
- 6-step wizard for full customization:
  - Step 1: Select Temple (วัดธาตุทอง, วัดมกุฏฯ, วัดเทพศิรินทร์, etc.)
  - Step 2: Select Days (3, 5, 7, 9 days)
  - Step 3: Select Casket (including 🌿 Eco-Friendly options: โลงไม้ไผ่สาน, โลงผักตบชวา)
  - Step 4: Select Cremation level (เมรุธรรมดา to เมรุ Royal)
  - Step 5: Catering + Floral (multiple select for catering)
  - Step 6: Extra services (Photo/Video, Live Streaming, Memorial Video, etc.)
- Real-time price calculation at each step
- Summary page with all selections and total

### UI Requirements:
- Start with Mode Selection screen (2 big buttons: Package vs Custom)
- Package cards should show: icon, name (EN+TH), tagline, duration/venue/guests, price range
- The Legacy package should have "⭐ แนะนำ" (Recommended) badge
- Eco-friendly caskets should have green "🌿 เป็นมิตรกับสิ่งแวดล้อม" badge
- Progress bar for Custom mode (Step X of 6)
- Keep dark theme with gold accents (#D4AF37)
- "Back to mode selection" button

### Package Data:
- The Memoir: 45,000-55,000 บาท, 3 days, small temple, 30-80 guests
- The Narrative: 120,000-150,000 บาท, 5 days, medium temple, 80-150 guests  
- The Legacy: 350,000-450,000 บาท, 7 days, large temple, 150-300 guests (RECOMMENDED)
- The Masterpiece: 800,000-1,000,000 บาท, 7+ days, premium temple, 300-500 guests

### Goal:
This new design separates "Package" (one-click complete solution) from "Custom" (full flexibility), making it clearer for customers and preventing price shock from too many add-ons.
